        <h1>About The Author</h1>
        <p>First published in 1954, Lord of The Rings was created by phenomenal writer J. R. R. Tolkien.</p>
        <p>It is an epic-high fantasy novel (although now frequently split into three (3) books, it was originally published
            as one) set in the land of Middle Earth.</p>
        <p>LoTR is a sequel to The Hobbit, a smaller novel which sets the stage for the main goal of the Lord of The Rings
            series - destroying the Ring of Power.</p>

        <h1>The Fellowship of The Ring</h1>
        <p>This is the first part of the series, and is much calmer and sweeter than the rest of the story.</p>
        <p>It focuses on introducing the reader to the main characters of the series and providing background for
            each so we, the reader, can understand their motivations.</p>
        <p>The story begins with the birthday party of the protagonist from The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, following which our new
            main character, Frodo Baggins, steps into the limelight. With no warning, he is thrust into a perilous
            quest to destroy a dangerous artifact by journeying to an even more dangerous mountain of fire.</p>
