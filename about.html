        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>First published in 1954, Lord of The Rings was created by phenomenal writer J. R. R. Tolkien. It is one of the most popular
            books ever written, having over 150 million copies sold.</p>
        <p>It is an epic-high fantasy novel set in the land of Middle Earth. Although now frequently split into three (3) books, it was originally intended
            to just be one (1) volume with six (6) sections, published alongside The Silmarillion. However, due to economic
        limitations, it was instead published in three (3) instalments between July 1954 and October 1955.</p>
        <p>LoTR is a sequel to The Hobbit, a smaller novel which sets the stage for the main goal of the Lord of The Rings
            series - destroying the Ring of Power.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Over the course of four (4) decades, there have been numerous attempted and successful adaptations of 
            The Lord of The Rings. Early attempts by John Boorman and George Lucas instead lead to the production of
            Excalibur and Willow, respectively.</p>
        <p>The first successful production was the animated adaptation of The Lord of The Rings by American Ralph Bakshi
            in 1978. Shortly after, Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment released a musical television adaptation in 1980.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>However, the adaptation that most are aware of is Peter Jackson's incredible trilogy release, beginning in the early 2000s.</p>
        <p>Filmed in New Zealand, Jackson's films are a breathtaking visual journey which truly brings the world of Middle Earth
            to life. From astonishing shots of snowy mountains and barren wastelands, to rolling hills and winding rivers, the Peter
            Jackson's adaptations have gone down in history.</p>
        <p>Jackson is also responsible for adapting The Hobbit to film, releasing three (3) instalments between 2012 and 2014, also filmed in
            New Zealand. Although only one (1) released book, the films were split into 'An Unexpected Journey,' 'The Desolation of Smaug' and 
            'The Battle of The Five Armies,' using content from the appendices of Tolkien's The Return of The King to expand upon the story
            told in The Hobbit novel.</p>

        <h2>The Fellowship of The Ring</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This is the first part of the series, and is much calmer and sweeter than the rest of the story.</p>
        <p>It focuses on introducing the reader to the main characters of the series and providing background for
            each so we, the reader, can understand their motivations.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The story begins with the birthday party of the protagonist from The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, following which our new
            main character, Frodo Baggins, steps into the limelight. With no warning, he is thrust into a perilous
            quest to destroy a dangerous artifact, known as The Ring of Power, by journeying to an even more dangerous mountain of fire.</p>
        <p>We are introduced to the members of the Fellowship, other recurring important characters and our main antagonist -
            The Dark Lord Sauron, whose Ring the Fellowship is on a journey to destroy in the hopes of preventing Middle Earth
            from falling into darkness.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>As the novel begins, Frodo is encouraged by Gandalf, a Wizard, to take the Ring far away from the Shire, where he lives.
            After Gandalf fails to arrive to accompany him, Frodo sets out on his own, being joined by Sam Gamgee, his gardener, Pippin
            Took, his cousin, and Merriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck, their friend, along the way.</p>
        <p>The group is pursued by mysterious Black Riders, who we later discover are servants of Sauron, before they eventually
            make it to Bree, where they meet a Ranger called Strider. Strider accompanies them to the Elven domain of Rivendell,
            however they are ambushed by Black Riders on the way and Frodo is seriously wounded.</p>
        <p>In Rivendell, a council is formed which decides that the Ring must be destroyed in the Fires of Mount Doom, where it
            was forged. The Fellowship is formed, containing the four Hobbits (Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry,) Strider and another Man
            named Boromir, an Elf named Legolas, a Dwarf named Gimli and Gandalf, the Wizard.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur, who first took the Ring, and true King of Gondor.</p>
        <p>Their plans are impeded early on when they are prevented from crossing the Misty Mountains, featured in The Hobbit,
            and instead have to take the perilous path through the Mines of Moria, where danger and uncertainty lie both within and after.</p>

        <h2>The Two Towers</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The second part of the series continues the action set up at the end of the previous novel with the Fellowship
            being hunted by Sauron's Orcs and Saruman's Uruk-hai. Although Saruman was part of the Istari, a group of Wizards sent
            to Middle Earth to destroy Sauron, Saruman quickly desired Sauron's power and abandoned his duties, becoming one of the
            prominent antagonists in the series.</p>
        <p>By this stage, the Fellowship has largely fragmented, with just Frodo and Sam remaining together to carry the Ring
            to Mount Doom.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Following Gandalf's battle in the Mines of Moria, he is now donned in white, having replaced Saruman as the principle Wizard. He frees
            Théoden, King of Rohan, from the grip of evil, who then rides with his men to Helm's Deep for battle.</p>
        <p>Merry and Pippin escape their previous captivity and come across Treebeard, part of a tree-like race known as Ents, following which the 
            Ents rise up to destroy Isengard, Saruman's seat of power and military production.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Frodo and Sam cross paths with Gollum, who was Ringbearer before Bilbo stole it from him in The Hobbit. Sworn to servitude, Gollum takes
            the duo to the Black Gate of Mordor, Sauron's seat of power, however it is too heavily guarded. They take an alternate path, however they
            are attacked by the giant spider, Shelob, leading Sam to believe Frodo has died. Consequently, Sam picks up the ring to continue the journey
            to Mount Doom, making him one of the Ringbearers.</p>

        <h2>The Return of The King</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Gandalf and Pippin travel to Minas Tirith to warn Denethor, Steward of Gondor, of the immenent arrival of Sauron's army.
            Deceived by the Dark Lord, Denethor burns himself alive on a pyre once the battle begins, leaving Gondor leaderless.</p>
        <p>Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas and Gimli, traverses the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, cursed oathbreakers
            who cannot rest until they fight for the King of Gondor. They travel back to Minas Tirith, where the benefit of having an undead army
            turns the tide of battle.</p>
        <p>Eowyn, Théoden's niece, defeats the Lord of the Nazgul, the Black Riders.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Far away, Sam rescues Frodo, who was captured after Shelob's attack, and together they continue the journey to Mount Doom. Unfortunately, the
            weight and influence of the Ring finally overpowers Frodo, who instead of destroying it takes it for himself. However, Gollum experiences the
            same pull, taking the Ring from Frodo but falls from the precipice into the lava below, taking the Ring with him.</p>
        <p>With the Ring finally destroyed, Sauron's tower collapses, his Nazgul lose all power and Aragorn's army emerges victorious. Shortly after,
            Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and the four (4) Hobbits return to the Shire.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The weight of the Ring and the wounds he sustained leave marks on Frodo, however, and a few years later he journeys to the Elvish
            Undying Lands, accompanied by Gandalf and Bilbo and, some time after, joined by Sam.
