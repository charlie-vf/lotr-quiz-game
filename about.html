        <h1>Background Information</h1>
        <p>First published in 1954, Lord of The Rings was created by phenomenal writer J. R. R. Tolkien. It is one of the most popular
            books ever written, having over 150 million copies sold.</p>
        <p>It is an epic-high fantasy novel set in the land of Middle Earth. Although now frequently split into three (3) books, it was originally intended
            to just be one (1) volume with six (6) sections, published alongside The Silmarillion. However, due to economic
        limitations, it was instead published in three (3) instalments between July 1954 and October 1955.</p>
        <p>LoTR is a sequel to The Hobbit, a smaller novel which sets the stage for the main goal of the Lord of The Rings
            series - destroying the Ring of Power.</p>
        <p>Over the course of four (4) decades, there have been numerous attempted and successful adaptations of 
            The Lord of The Rings. Early attempts by John Boorman and George Lucas instead lead to the production of
            Excalibur and Willow, respectively.</p>
        <p>The first successful production was the animated adaptation of The Lord of The Rings by American Ralph Bakshi
            in 1978. Shortly after, Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment released a musical television adaptation in 1980.</p>
        <p>However, the adaptation that most are aware of is Peter Jackson's incredible trilogy release, beginning in the early 2000s.</p>
        <p>Filmed in New Zealand, Jackson's films are a breathtaking visual journey which truly brings the world of Middle Earth
            to life. From astonishing shots of snowy mountains and barren wastelands, to rolling hills and winding rivers, the Peter
            Jackson's adaptations have gone down in history.</p>
        <p>Jackson is also responsible for adapting The Hobbit to film, releasing three (3) instalments between 2012 and 2014, also filmed in
            New Zealand. Although only one (1) released book, the films were split into 'An Unexpected Journey,' 'The Desolation of Smaug' and 
            'The Battle of The Five Armies,' using content from the appendices of Tolkien's The Return of The King to expand upon the story
            told in The Hobbit novel.</p>

        <h1>The Fellowship of The Ring</h1>
        <p>This is the first part of the series, and is much calmer and sweeter than the rest of the story.</p>
        <p>It focuses on introducing the reader to the main characters of the series and providing background for
            each so we, the reader, can understand their motivations.</p>
        <p>The story begins with the birthday party of the protagonist from The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, following which our new
            main character, Frodo Baggins, steps into the limelight. With no warning, he is thrust into a perilous
            quest to destroy a dangerous artifact, known as The Ring of Power, by journeying to an even more dangerous mountain of fire.</p>
        <p>We are introduced to the members of the Fellowship, other recurring important characters and our main antagonist -
            The Dark Lord Sauron, whose Ring the Fellowship is on a journey to destroy in the hopes of preventing Middle Earth
            from falling into darkness.</p>
        <p>As the novel begins, Frodo is encouraged by Gandalf, a Wizard, to take the Ring far away from the Shire, where he lives.
            After Gandalf fails to arrive to accompany him, Frodo sets out on his own, being joined by Sam Gamgee, his gardener, Pippin
            Took, his cousin, and Merriadoc (Merry) Brandybuck, their friend, along the way.</p>
        <p>The group is pursued by mysterious Black Riders, who we later discover are servants of Sauron, before they eventually
            make it to Bree, where they meet a Ranger called Strider. Strider accompanies them to the Elven domain of Rivendell,
            however they are ambushed by Black Riders on the way and Frodo is seriously wounded.</p>
        <p>In Rivendell, a council is formed which decides that the Ring must be destroyed in the Fires of Mount Doom, where it
            was forged. The Fellowship is formed, containing the four Hobbits (Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry,) Strider and another Man
            named Boromir, an Elf named Legolas, a Dwarf named Gimli and Gandalf, the Wizard.</p>
        <p>Their plans are impeded early on when they are prevented from crossing the Misty Mountains, featured in The Hobbit,
            and instead have to take the perilous path through the Mines of Moria, where danger and uncertainty lie both within and after.</p>

        <h1>The Two Towers</h1>
        <p>The second part of the series continues the action set up at the end of the previous novel with the Fellowship
            being hunted by Sauron's Orcs and Saruman's Uruk-hai. Although Saruman was part of the Istari, a group of Wizards sent
            to Middle Earth to destroy Sauron, Saruman quickly desired Sauron's power and abandoned his duties, becoming one of the
            prominent antagonists in the series.</p>
